# Moddery
An open-source, web-based mod builder for Minecraft

**<span style="color:red;">NOTE: This is at a very early stage of development. It is unstable, and you can't even export a mod yet.</span>**

This Minecraft mod builder is unlike the rest. Other ones have to be installed on your device, only work on some platforms, and are plagued with Java compilation errors. This one runs entirely in the browser and is compatible with all devices that run modern browsers and are at least as large as a tablet.
